# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the price of a car based on various features such as mileage, year, engine size, and more. The prediction is performed using a Linear Regression model and the application is built using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing, building the model pipeline, and evaluation.
- **Pickle**: For loading the pre-trained model.

## Features
- **Car Price Prediction**: Predict car prices based on inputs like year, mileage, engine size, etc.
- **Interactive UI**: Input car features and get an immediate price prediction.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage
1. Enter the details of the car (year, mileage, engine size, etc.).
2. Click on "Predict Price" to get the estimated car price.
3. Explore the accuracy of predictions using the provided metrics.

## Performance Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (R²) Score**
